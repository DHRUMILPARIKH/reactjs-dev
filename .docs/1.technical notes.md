### What `react-dom/client` will do ?
   - Answer : ``import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
     const root = createRoot(domNode, options?)`` 
     createRoot lets you create a root to display React components inside a browser DOM node.

     peerDependencies:   "react": "^17.0.0"
     dependencies:  "loose-envify": "^1.1.0"

      "browserify": {
        "transform": [
            "loose-envify"
        ]
      }
 ### Browserify: ( Bundler tool )
 - Browserify is an open-source JavaScript bundler tool that allows developers to write and use Node.js-style modules that compile for use in the browser.    
 - Browsers don't have the require method defined, but Node.js does. With Browserify you can write code that uses require in the same way that you would use it in Node.
 - Internals: Use AST (Abstract syntax tree)

### npm package.json dependencies vs PeerDependencies
-  Good article: https://indepth.dev/posts/1187/npm-peer-dependencies (npm Peer Dependencies)
-  Transitive dependencies (indirect dependency): 
        Project direct dependencies (TODD_1:0.0.1) ->  Transitive dependencies (dependency of TODD_1:0.0.1)
